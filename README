Enquisitor Version 0.1

About
-----
Enquisitor is a digital Gamesmaster for Games Workshop's Inquistor table top 
roleplaying game.

Installation
------------
There's no files yet, so this is not something to worry about.

I write in python 2.6, but include compatibility patches for 2.5.

Python 3 code should be forked.
